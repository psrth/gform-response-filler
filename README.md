# Google Form â€” Response Filler
## uhh like it fills a spreadsheet with random responses and stuff

## Origin Story
I have a **Tech [redacted] Writing** assignment due this weekend. This is a probable failsafe if we forget to send out a form.

## Rules of Use
1. Please don't be stupid. 
2. Please name the file something Google would name it before submitting anywhere.
3. Maybe export this to Google Sheets and share that.
4. Please don't be stupid (again).

## To-Do
idk if people use this i'll add screenshots and a how-to-guide and maybe hook this up to gsheets macros but don't count on it lol
